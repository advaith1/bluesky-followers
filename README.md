# ðŸ¦‹ Bluesky Follower Explorer

A Next.js static site that lets you explore follow connections on the [Bluesky](https://bsky.social/about) network, fetching client-side using Bluesky's public API and [`@atproto/api`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/api). You can intersect one user's following list with another user's follows list and see users sorted by follower count.
